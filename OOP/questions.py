# variables of the class you create like self.name = "Ali") i.e, name and breed.
# The value of these attributes should be initialized when the object for this class is created.
# Create 2 methods bark and get_breed, bark should return a string "{self.name} says Woof!"
# and get_breed should return the string "{self.name} is a {self.breed}"
