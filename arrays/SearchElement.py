# You are given a list of elements and a target element. Write a Python program to determine whether the target element exists in the given list.

# Write a Python function called element_exists(arr, target) that takes two parameters:

# arr (a list): The list of elements to search in.
# target: The element you need to check for existence in the list.

# Eg: element_exists([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3)
